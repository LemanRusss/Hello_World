            <line>And hear this matter with reverence,</line>
            <line>By figure a moral play--</line>
            <line>The Summoning of <referent char="Everyman">Everyman</referent> called it
                is,</line>
            <line>That of our lives and ending shows</line>
            <line>How transitory we be all day.</line>
            <line>This matter is wondrous precious,</line>
            <line>But the intent of it is more gracious,</line>
            <line>And sweet to bear away.</line>
            <line>The story saith,--Man, in the beginning,</line>
            <line>Look well, and take good heed to the ending,</line>
            <line>Be you never so gay!</line>
            <line>Ye think sin in the beginning full sweet,</line>
            <line>Which in the end causeth thy soul to weep,</line>
            <line>When the body lieth in clay.</line>
            <line>Here shall you see how <referent char="Fellowship">Fellowship</referent> and
                    <referent char="Jollity">Jollity</referent>,</line>

            <line>Will fade from thee as flower in May.</line>
            <line>For ye shall hear, how <referent char="God">our heaven king</referent></line>
            <line>Calleth <referent char="Everyman">Everyman</referent> to a general
                reckoning:</line>
            <line>Give audience, and hear what he doth say.</line>

        <speech>
            <line><speaker char="God">God</speaker> I perceive here in my majesty,</line>
            <line>How that all creatures be to me unkind,</line>
            <line>Living without dread in worldly prosperity:</line>
            <line>Of ghostly sight the people be so blind,</line>
            <line>Drowned in sin, they know me not for their <referent char="God"
                >God</referent>;</line>
            <line>In worldly riches is all their mind,</line>
            <line>They fear not my rightwiseness, the sharp rod;</line>
            <line>My law that I shewed, when I for them died,</line>
            <line>They forget clean, and shedding of my blood red;</line>
            <line>I hanged between two, it cannot be denied;</line>
            <line>To get them life I suffered to be dead;</line>
            <line>I healed their feet, with thorns hurt was my head:</line>
            <line>I could do no more than I did truly,</line>
            <line>And now I see the people do clean forsake me.</line>
            <line>They use the seven deadly sins damnable;</line>
            <line>As pride, covetise, wrath, and lechery,</line>
            <line>Now in the world be made commendable;</line>
            <line>And thus they leave of angels the heavenly company;</line>
            <line><referent char="Everyman">Everyman</referent> liveth so after his own
                pleasure,</line>
            <line>And yet of their life they be nothing sure:</line>
            <line>I see the more that I them forbear</line>
            <line>The worse they be from year to year;</line>
            <line>All that liveth appaireth<note n="7"/> fast,</line>
            <line>Therefore I will in all the haste</line>
            <line>Have a reckoning of <referent char="Everyman">Everyman</referent>'s person</line>
            <line>For and I leave the people thus alone</line>
            <line>In their life and wicked tempests,</line>
            <line>Verily they will become much worse than beasts;</line>
            <line>For now one would by envy another up eat;</line>
            <line>Charity they all do clean forget.</line>
            <line>I hoped well that <referent char="Everyman">Everyman</referent></line>
            <line>In my glory should make his mansion,</line>
            <line>And thereto I had them all elect;</line>
            <line>But now I see, like traitors deject,</line>
            <line>They thank me not for the pleasure that I to them meant,</line>
            <line>Nor yet for their being that I them have lent;</line>
            <line>I proffered the people great multitude of mercy,</line>
            <line>And few there be that asketh it heartily;</line>
            <line>They be so cumbered with worldly riches,</line>
            <line>That needs on them I must do justice,</line>
            <line>On <referent char="Everyman">Everyman</referent> living without fear.</line>

        <!--WHC 20-FEB-2021: this speech contains many titles for God. I haven't marked each one, as in a sense the whole speech (down to the address to Mary) is a single address to God, so it would be wrong for mathematial purposes to count it as many references. However, if preparing a list of the many titles used for God in this play, it would be desirable to makr up each. This would best be achieved though a more complex use of attribute values.-->
